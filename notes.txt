                                            Docker Tutorial

=> Docker Engine
 -> When you install docker in your system it install the docker engine. Which hosts linux to
 run the docker.

=> Getting Started
 -> Define a DockerFile in your project directory
    
        FROM node:14

        WORKDIR /app

        COPY package.json .

        RUN npm install

        COPY . .

        EXPOSE 3000

        CMD [ "node", "app.mjs" ]

 -> After that run the following command
    "docker build ."
    - The above command will create a new docker image based upon the DockerFile configuration.
    - After creating the docker image you will get the image id.
 
 -> Now you need to expost the docker's port 3000 to your computer's port 3000
    - docker run -p 3000:3000 d196f5a194d61bca9bdc82086f72c90f05d8adae35074baec3d5425d9db35afb
    - After the above command you will docker container will be started.

 -> "docker ps"
    - This command will list all the running docker containers.
 
 -> Stop the docker
    - "docker stop docker_name"

=> Images And container
 -> Image is a template. It contains the code and the execution dependencies.
 -> Images are blueprint for containers.
 -> Container is the running unit of software.
 -> Multiple containers can be created using a single image.

=> Inbuit images.
 -> Docker hub has lot of pre build images.
 -> Ex: "docker run node"

=> "docker ps -a"
 -> This command list out all the process created by docker.

=> To expose the terminal of image to host machine
 -> "docker run -it node"

=> run command creates a instance of image.
